                <p>
                    Despite a few warts we - or I (Hi, it's Phil writing this) - 
                    believe that Bluesky is a much better foundation for growing
                    and nurturing a community. And we'd love to invite you along!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hear us out for a moment here! It's not all doom and gloom,
                    after all- isn't the whole *point* of what we've all gathered
                    together for - we, the maker community - to learn and grow and
                    embrace new and exciting things?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bluesky is a new thing and, while the name is rather on the nose,
                    it nonetheless legitimately an exciting and fertile ground of possibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this guide we'll introduce you to the tools Bluesky provides
                    to reconnect with your maker friends, build and curate your own
                    community feeds, curate your own lists of awesome folks and
                    generally take a little bit more charge of your social experience.
                </p>

                    New things are daunting. Entering a new space that's already
                    occupied is daunting, but I have good news for you: it's 
                    occupied with your maker brethren. Some of the coolest folks
                    around are already here sharing their projects- you just gotta
                    find 'em!
                </p>
                <h3>And that's where starter packs come in...</h3>
                <p>
                    Bluesky has this awesome concept called "Starter Packs," these
                    are user-curated lists of people that you can follow with one
                    click (or cherry pick, if you prefer). Since what you see on
                    Bluesky is easier to manage, you'll also find that follow-backs
                    are liberal- you'll rebuild your network in no time.

                <p>
                    Rather than siloing you into an algorithmic pit of despair
                    Bluesky empowers used to create, curate and moderate their
                    own content feeds- showing posts from select tags, search terms,
                    users or even just ones inserted manually.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can find feeds people have created either by looking at
                    the "Feeds" tab in their profile, or by searching within "Feeds"
                    (in the left-hand menu of the BlueSky website).
                </p>
                <p>
                    While feeds ostensibly require a bit of programming know-how to
                    set up, it's possible to use services like <a href="https://Blueskyfeedcreator.com">Bluesky Feed Creator</a>
                    and bash together your own feed in minutes!
                </p>
                <p>
                    With feeds *you* (or your friends) write the algorithm, effectively
                    giving you a little community bubble away from the general riff-raff.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Feeds get added to your sidebar, or tabulated along the top of
                    the app and you can switch between them at your own leisure.

                    None of this stuff is essential, but if you're invested in
                    making BlueSky a nicer place to be for yourself, and others,
                    then the advice that follows might help!

                <h3 id="alt-text">Image and video alt text.</h3>
                <p>
                    When you post an image you might find a little "+ Alt" button
                    in the top left corner of each image. You should tap this and
                    take a moment to fill out alt text describing the image contents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is useful both for visually impaired users, and for folks
                    who just want a little more context about what's in the image -
                    we can't all tell a Pico W from an ESP32-S2 by looking at it,
                    ya know!
                </p>
                <p>
                    When writing alt text, avoid prefixing photos with "Photo of"
                    since this is usually implied. Be brief and specific, selecting
                    the elements of the image that are relevant and important- you
                    don't need to describe everything in exhaustive detail. Avoid
                    overly brief descriptions like "Cup" (yes I saw this in the wild
                    once).
                </p>

                    "Why should I care, can't AI do it!?" Sure, kinda, but *you*
                    should be the one writing alt text for your images, since only
                    you understand the meaning behind the image and the context
                    surrounding it when it's posted. Is AI gonna tell the difference
                    between your lovingly crafted, hand-wired mechanical keyboard
                    and a birds nest?

                <p>
                    It seems obvious, but if you're going to hop on BlueSky and
                    start following people by the bucketload - which is a little
                    controversial (and rightfully so) with some users - you should
                    at least create a bio, and make a post introducing yourself!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let people know who you are, what you do, and what they might
                    already know you for- handy if you're trying to remake lost
                    connections from... the other place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Similarly if you're following new people, re-making connections
                    or just trying to find your place- stop and say hi!

                <p>
                    As part of the moderation framework of BlueSky, third parties
                    can assign labels to accounts which are displayed on your profile.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These labels can indicate someone's industry affiliations, or
                    their chosen pronouns or... other... tidbits of information
                    about an account.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You should start with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pronouns.adorable.mom">@pronouns.adorable.mom</a>
                    where you should "Subscribe" and select "Posts" for instructions
                    about how to label your own account. The UX is a bit jank at
                    the moment, but it'll be strangely familiar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even if you're not concerned about your pronouns, it's
                    helpful to pick ones relevant to you and normalise their use.
